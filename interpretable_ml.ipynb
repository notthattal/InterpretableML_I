This makes sense, as the longer a person stays with the company the higher the total charges would be. In order to meet our threshold, I chose to drop the monthly charges and tenure columns. Monthly charges can be correlated to many other features such as if the customer pays for fiber optics, phone service etc. Once we drop monthly charges and tenure, we still have PhoneService which surpasses our threshold, so I chose to drop all three columns to meet the threshold we decided on earlier"

For both logistic regression and the GAM we saw similar results in terms of accuracy and f1 score, and were able to interpret that both models are underfitting the data.
